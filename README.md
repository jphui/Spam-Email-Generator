**=== Backstory ===**

In my high school CSIII class, there was only one lab that I couldn't complete, and as a completionist, I decided that I would finish it as a quarantine side project. I looked through my old folders for saved source code but ultimately found nothing. So, I started from square one relearning data structures, polymorphism and especially the forgotten basics of Java syntax. This lab was unique because our CS teacher explained to us the immediate application of Markov Chains: natural language processing, gene sequencing, and most interestingly, *spam emails*. 

So, although I completed the [lab](https://github.com/jphui/Markov-Chains) with minor issues, I wanted to take it a step further because I saw it as an opportunity to turn something done inside the classroom into a working product, which I had never done before, and up until now, have never done. Ulimately I was excited to learn about and use the tools that bring backend to frontend, something that I was disappointed had never been taught in any course I had taken. And honestly, who *doesn't* want to generate smart, tailored spam emails?

**=== Project Development ===**

Finishing the lab was the easy part, because software development had been drilled into me for the past six years. However, I realized that turning this into a functional webapp would be quite an uphill battle with ***0 experience*** with web development. Despite a lack of direction, I knew two things after asking Reddit and CS-savvy friends: Spring Boot and Heroku.

I quickly understood that Spring Boot was an obvious choice because I needed what I learned was called a *"framework"* for the Java code I had already written and because as a framework, it has an unparalleled ease to get set up. As such, it was relatively easy to pick up after sponging information from some incredibly helpful YouTube tutorials (*cough cough Brandan Jones*), but combined with learning HTML and REST basics from the ground up, it was more time consuming than I had thought. Since most enterprise-grade applications involve the use of a database, I ended up having to add code to mold the shape of my project around the *M* part of MVC, something I am glad I won't have to do for anything more normal.
